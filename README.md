# 🐍 AI Enhanced Snake Game

An advanced version of the classic Snake game, enhanced with AI techniques like **A* Search Algorithm** and **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** logic for intelligent movement and obstacle avoidance.

This project was developed as part of an academic mini-project to demonstrate the application of AI concepts to classic games.

---

## 🎯 Project Highlights

✅ Classic Snake gameplay recreated using **Python** and **Pygame**  
✅ Integrated **A* pathfinding** for optimal food-seeking behavior  
✅ Demonstrates **CSP-based movement logic** for intelligent decision-making  
✅ Switch between manual and AI-controlled gameplay

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pygame (for graphics and game loop)  
- Standard AI algorithms implemented manually (no external AI libraries)

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Enhanced-Snake-Game.git
   cd AI-Enhanced-Snake-Game
````

2. **Install Requirements**

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the Game**

   ```bash
   python snake_ai.py
   ```

## 🕹️ Controls

* **Arrow Keys** — Manual control of the snake
* **AI Mode Toggle** — (If implemented) Activate AI control for the snake
* The snake intelligently finds food using A\* or CSP algorithms when AI mode is active

---

## 🧠 AI Techniques Used

* **A* Pathfinding Algorithm*\*

  * Finds the shortest path to food while avoiding obstacles
* **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Logic**

  * Ensures safe movement by considering surrounding grid constraints
* Simple heuristics for efficient snake survival
